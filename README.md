Welcome to **Chapa Trial for Devs** 🎉  
This repo is a **playground for programmers** who want to learn and test how [Chapa](https://chapa.co/) 💳 (a payment gateway in Ethiopia & Africa) works.  

It’s simple: try out code → see payments in action → share your experiments → help others learn.

---

## 🚀 What’s Inside?
- Sample code to start payments with Chapa  
- Examples in **HTML, CSS, JS, PHP** (more welcome!)  
- How to handle **payment responses and callbacks**  
- Open for **community contributions** 🤝

## 🛠 How to Use
1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chapa-trial.git

2. Try the examples (replace with your Chapa sandbox keys).


3. Add your own code (could be Node.js, Python, Laravel, etc.).


4. Run and test locally – see how payments work step by step.
